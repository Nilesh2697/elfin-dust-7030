          We have a tendency to judge how our exercise routine and diet are
          working by what the bathroom scale reads. But that should not be the
          only indicator. With each bout of exercise, we are improving various
          aspects of our physiology and health that may not be visible to the
          naked eye.

          When involved in any strength training routine, a strong back is a
          must. It is important to allocate equal time to all the major muscle
          groups when training. When we refer to major muscle groups we’re
          talking specifically about the following six areas: Major Muscle
          Groups Legs/Hips Back Chest Shoulders Arms Core (abdominals etc.)

          Fasting can be traced back to at least the 5th century BC to Greek
          physician Hippocrates. The “Father of Medicine” recommended abstinence
          from food and drink for patients when showing certain symptoms of
          illness. Intermittent fasting (IF) as a dietary regimen appears to
          have started back in the 1940’s here in the U.S.

          Pull-ups have always been a great exercise to do and you only need
          your bodyweight and a bar to do them. For those who can’t do a pull up
          yet, you may be looking to get your first one. For those who can,
          you’re probably looking to increase the number that you can do.

          You may have heard it before, but it’s worth repeating: You are what
          you eat. If you’re eating a lot of junk food, you’re going to feel
          like junk. But if you’re eating healthy, you’ll feel great. When it
          comes to working out, getting in shape – and remaining as such – helps
          boost your metabolism, burns fat, and builds muscle. However, to do
          that, you need to eat the right foods to support your workouts and
          help your body recover after a tough workout session.
